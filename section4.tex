- the metric on the tensor is the usual tensor metric, the metric on the function space is the usual function metric, the metric on multisets is the multiset metric

- concavity

- Lipschitz-continuity. Highlight compositional reasoning based on Lipschitz.

- Discussion of unary tropical Laurent series, i.e.~$f:\Lawv \to \Lawv$:
\begin{itemize}

\item $f$ is locally a polynomial (i.e.~a $\min$) but not globally

\item singular points: the famous example

\item tropical roots


\end{itemize}



- discussion of the tropical Taylor expansion: 


- characterization of the functional metric using derivatives
