Recall the two approaches with more details on lambda-calculus and on existing challenges.

- Metric models: functions as Lipschitz maps, differential privacy.

- Problem with unrestricted duplications

- Bounded Linear Logic/lambda-calculus, why Met is only a model of BLL, and why it is difficult (but not impossible!) to construct models of full lambda


- Differential lambda-calculus: differential operator, Taylor expansion (vs. 1)

- resource lambda-terms, Taylor expansion (vs. 2)

- resource lambdas are polynomials, so not linear. Why we need tropical geometry here.
