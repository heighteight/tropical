%Recall the two approaches with more details on lambda-calculus and on existing challenges.

\subsection{Metric approach: bounded $\lambda$-terms as Lipschitz functions}

- Metric models: functions as Lipschitz maps, differential privacy.

- Problem with unrestricted duplications

- Bounded Linear Logic/lambda-calculus, why Met is only a model of BLL, and why it is difficult (but not impossible!) to construct models of full lambda

\subsection{Resource approach: differential $\lambda$-terms as polynomials}

- Differential lambda-calculus: differential operator, Taylor expansion (vs. 1)

- resource lambda-terms, Taylor expansion (vs. 2)

- resource lambdas are polynomials, so not linear. 

\subsection{Tropical mathematics: a possible synthesis}

- generalities about tropical maths (tropicalisation $\trop P$  of polynomials and of Laurent series, and their roots -- all that without $\LREL$)
