%Recall the two approaches with more details on lambda-calculus and on existing challenges.


%In this section, we discuss in some more detail the two approaches to quantitative semantics we mentioned in the Introduction, at the same time providing an overview of how we aim at bridging them using tropical mathematics.

\paragraph*{Controlled duplication/erasure via graded types: bounded $\lambda$-calculus $\BSTLC$}\label{sec:BSTLC}

These observations have led to the study of linear $\lambda$-calculi with \emph{graded} exponentials, like $\mathsf{Fuzz}$ \cite{Reed2010}, inspired from Girard's Bounded Linear Logic \cite{Girard92tcs}, which have been applied to the study of differential privacy \cite{Gaboardi2013, Gaboardi2017}. The types of such systems are defined by combining linear constructors with a \emph{graded linear exponential comonad} $!_{r}(-)$ \cite{Katsumata2018}.
The language $\BSTLC$ we consider is a simplified version of the language $\mathrm{Fuzz}$ \cite{Reed2010}. 
The terms are as for the $\STLC$, the types are $A::= * \ \mid  \ !_{n}A \multimap A$ and type judgements are of the form $\Gamma \vdash M:A$, where a context $\Gamma$ is a set of declarations of the form $x :_{n}A$, with $n\in \mathbb N$.
The typing rules are: %given in Fig.~\ref{fig:rules}
	\[ \scriptsize \arraycolsep=5pt\def\arraystretch{2.8}
	\begin{array}{cccc}
		\prooftree
		\Gamma \vdash M:A
		\justifies
		\Gamma, x:_{0}B \vdash M:A
		\endprooftree 
		&
		\prooftree
		\Gamma, x:_{n}B, y:_{m} B\vdash M:A
		\justifies
		\Gamma, x:_{n+m}B\vdash M\{x/y\}:A
		\endprooftree 
		&
		\prooftree
		\Gamma, x:_{n} A\vdash M: B
		\justifies
		\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.M: !_{n}A\multimap B
		\endprooftree
		&
		\prooftree
		\Gamma \vdash M: !_nA\multimap B
		\quad
		\Delta\vdash N: A
		\justifies
		\Gamma +n\Delta\vdash MN: B
		\endprooftree
	\end{array}
	\]
where $\Gamma+\Delta$ is defined letting $(\Gamma, x:_{m} A)+( \Delta, x:_{n} A) =  (\Gamma+\Delta), x:_{m+n}A$, and $m\Gamma$ is made all $x:_{mn}A$ for $(x:_{n}A) \in \Gamma$.  
The axiom is $x:_{1}A\vdash x: A$.
The main feature of this language is that if $\vdash \lambda x.M:\,!_nA\multimap B$, then $x$ will be duplicated exactly $n$ times in the reduction to the normal form.
%E.g., $\vdash_{\BSTLC} \lambda {\color{red}z}.\left( \lambda x{\color{green}y}. yxx \right)z : \, !_{\color{red}2} *\multimap !_{\color{green}1}(!_{\color{violet}1} * \multimap !_{\color{blue}1} * \multimap *) \multimap *$.
%Observe that one can always type an affine term like e.g.~$\lambda xy.x$ with a linear type $A\multimap B\multimap A$. Instead, a term like $\lambda xy.x(xy)$ containing two occurrences of $x$ cannot be given the linear type $(A\multimap A)\multimap (A\multimap A)$ but a type of the form
%$!_{2}(A\multimap A)\multimap (A\multimap A)$. 

%\begin{remark}\label{rmk:ModelsOfBSTLC}
%Similarly to It is known {\color{red}(([reference??] e dire meglio)} 
The $\BSTLC$ can be interpreted in a symmetric monoidal closed category (SMCC) equipped with a \emph{$\mathbb N$-graded linear exponential comonad} \cite{Katsumata2018}.
Now, one can see that the exponential $!$ can be ``decomposed'' into a family of \emph{graded} exponentials functors $!_n:\LREL\to\LREL$ ($n\in\BB N$), defined on objects by taking multisets of cardinality \emph{at most} $n$. %  lift to functors 
The sequence $(!_n)_{n\in\N}$ gives rise to a $\N$-graded linear exponential comonad on (the SMC) $\LREL$, %satisfying the adjunction: $\LREL(Z\otimes !_{n}X,Y) \simeq \LREL(Z, !_{n}X\multimap Y)$.
i.e.\ $(\LREL,(!_n)_{n\in\N})$ is a model of $\BSTLC$. 
In particular, bounded arrow types are interpreted via $\model{!_{n}A\multimap B}:= !_{n}\model A \times \model B$ and so, 
if $\model *$ is finite, then $\model{A}$ is a finite set for any type $A$ of $\BSTLC$.
%\end{remark}
%Bounded types are interesting because of the following proposition:
%\begin{proposition}
%For all bounded types $A,B$, the morphisms from $\model A$ to $\model B$ (in all parametric relational models) correspond to polynomials.
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%It suffices to check that $\model A$ is finite for all bounded types $A$. Indeed this implies that a morphism $t:\model A\to \model B$ is a finite matrix $t: \model A \times \model B \to \Lawv$.Hence, its corresponding map $\widehat t:\Lawv^{\model A} \to \Lawv^{\model B}$ is a polynomial.
%\end{proof}

%For example (here $!_{n}(\Lawv^{X}):= \Lawv^{\C M_{\leq n}(X)}$):
%\begin{itemize}
%\item a map $f\in \LREL( !_{1}\Lawv, \Lawv)$ is of the form $f(x)=\min \{x+a,b\}$;
%\item a map $f\in \LREL(!_{2}\Lawv, \Lawv)$ is a ``quadratic'' polynomial $f(x)=\min\{2x+a, x+b, c\}$.
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Controlled duplication/erasure via resources: the differential $\lambda$-calculus $\STDLC$}\label{sec:STDLC}

The syntax of the differential $\lambda$-calculus $\STDLC$ (e.g.\ \cite[Section 3]{Manzo2010}), is given by the \emph{terms} $M$ and the \emph{sums} $\mathbb T$, mutually generated by: $M::= x\mid \lambda x.M \mid M\mathbb T \mid \Diff{M}{M}$ and $\mathbb T::= 0 \mid M \mid M+\mathbb T$,
quotiented by: $\alpha$-equivalence; $+,0$ form a commutative monoid on the set of sums; %, i.e.\ commutativity and associativity of $+$ and neutrality of $0$ w.r.t.\ $+$;
linearity of $\lam x.(\_)$, $\Diff{\_}{\_}$ and $(\_)\mathbb T$ (but \emph{not} of $M(\_)$); irrelevance of the order of consecutive $\Diff{\_}{\_}$.
%Remark that $M(\_)$ is \emph{not} set to be linear: $\lambda x.0=0\mathbb T=\Diff{0}{N}=\Diff{M}{0}=0$ but $M0\neq0$ in general.
%This is crucial for the definition of the Taylor expansion.
We follow the tradition of quotienting also for the idempotency of $+$.
%Sums are, then, just \emph{finite} sets of terms.
Simple types are $A::= *\mid A\to A$.
The typing rules are: %in Figure~\ref{fig:rules}
	\[ \scriptsize \arraycolsep=5pt\def\arraystretch{2.8}
	\begin{array}{cccc}
		\prooftree
		\Gamma, x: A\vdash M: B

where a context $\Gamma$ is a list of typed variable declarations.
The axioms are $\Gamma, x:A \vdash x: A$ and $\Gamma\vdash 0:A$.

%In $\BSTLC$ the typing system handles duplications; in $\STDLC$ the syntax with its operational semantics (that we do not give) does it.
\begin{comment}
Writing $\Der^2[\_,(\_)^2]$ as a shortcut for $\Der[\Der[\_,\_],\_]$ and $\Der^1[\_,(\_)^1]$ for $\Diff{\_}{\_}$, the analogue of the previous $\BSTLC$-term is $\vdash_{\STDLC} \lambda {\color{red}z}. \Der^{\color{red}2}[
	\lambda x{\color{green}y}.
		\Der^{\color{violet}1} [
				\Der^{\color{blue}1} [y, x^{\color{blue}1}]
        0, x^{\color{violet}1}
	]0
, z^{\color{red}2}]0
: {\color{red}*}\to ({\color{green}* \to * \to *}) \to *$.
%Here we wrote $\Der^2[\_]\cdot (\_)^2$ as a shortcut for $\Der[\Der[\_]\cdot (\_)]\cdot (\_)$ and $\Der^1[\_]\cdot (\_)^1$ for $\Der[\_]\cdot (\_)$.
In particular, if the \emph{multiplicities} of the arguments (the colored exponents) do not exactly match the number of duplications, e.g.\ in $\vdash_{\STDLC} \lambda z. \Der^{\color{red}3}[
	\lambda xy.
		\Diff{
				\Diff{y}{x}
		0}{x}
	0
, z^{\color{red}3}]0
: *\to (* \to * \to *) \to *$, then the term reduces to the empty sum $0$ (representing an \emph{error}).
\end{comment}
%Correspondingly, the syntax of the simply typed \emph{differential} $\lambda$-calculus ($\STDLC$) is defined by enriching $\STLC$ with a monoid structure $0,+$ over terms, as well as with $\Der$ and a notion of \emph{linear substitution} (see \cite{difflambda} or the Appendix for details).

Another intriguing similarity between program derivatives and 
actual derivatives is provided by the \emph{Taylor expansion} $\C T$:
%In analysis, a sufficiently regular function can be seen (locally around a point) as its Taylor expansion, i.e.\ a series of polynomials weighted via some rational coefficient.
%Now, a polynomial in $x$ of degree $k$ can be thought of as a function which uses its argument $x$ exactly $k$ times.
in $\STDLC$ (even untyped), we can perform a syntactic Taylor expansion of an ordinary $\lambda$-term via an inductively defined map $\Theta$ giving rise to an infinite series of terms, whose crucial case of the definition is
$
\Theta(MN)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\frac{1}{n!}\Der^n\left[\Theta(M),\Theta(N)^n\right]0.
$
As in analysis, it decomposes an application as a series of $k$-linear functions, which can be seen as its approximants.
In other words, unbounded duplications correspond to some sort of limit of bounded, but arbitrarily large, ones.
Since we only consider idempotent sum, the factorial coefficient disappears, and the resulting Taylor map is called the \emph{qualitative} Taylor expansion, indicated by $\Te{\_}$.
% (this perspective is made clearer by the related approach of the \emph{resource $\lambda$-calculus} \cite{}).

%Until now we simply specialised well-known results in our tropical case, with the intent of showing how things read in this particular case.
%Now we go further, by showing that $\LREL_!$ actually admits a \emph{differential structure}, turning it into a model of the $\STDLC$, i.e.~a $CC\partial C$.
%This viewpoint
%, is where the \emph{metric} and the \emph{differential} viewpoints converge, as explained in the Introduction and Section II, and it % will be further generalised in Section \ref{section6}.

%A model of the $\STDLC$ is usually understood as so-called \emph{Cartesian closed differential categories} (CC$\partial$C), see \cite{Manzo2012} for details.
%In order to treat the $+$ and the constructor $D[\_]\cdot (\_)$ of $\STDLC$, the main features of a CC$\partial$C $\C C$ are that:
%
%1) $\C C$ is a left-additive-CCC, i.e.\ its Homsets are commutative monoids and its Cartesian closed structure is well behaved w.r.t.\ this monoid structure;
%
%2) $\C C$ is equipped with a differential operator map $D:\HOM{\C C}{X}{Y}\to \HOM{\C C}{X\times X}{Y}$ (here $\times$ is the Cartesian product of $\C C$) satisfying $8$ axioms, called D1, ..., D7, D-curry.

%Let us show the differential structure of $\LREL_!$ (remember that the Cartesian product of $\LREL_!$ is the disjoint union $+$).

%\begin{definition} The \emph{tropical differential operator} is the map $D:\HOM{\LREL}{!X}{Y}\to \HOM{\LREL}{!(X+X)}{Y}$ defined as $(Dt)_{\mu\oplus\rho,b}=t_{\rho+\mu,b}$ if $\#\mu=1$ and as $\infty$ otherwise (where a multiset $\nu \in !(X+X)$ is identified with a disjoint sum of $\mu,\rho\in !X$).\end{definition}

%The models of $\STDLC$ are the cartesian \emph{closed} differential categories ($CC\partial C$), which are defined as $C\partial C$ which are also cartesian closed, and in which the monoid structure and the differential operator are both well-behaved with respect to the closed structure \cite{Manzo2012}. 
The $\STDLC$ can be interpreted in Cartesian closed differential $\lambda$-categories (CC$\partial\lambda$C)\cite{Manzo2010,Blute2009, Blute2019}.
In them, homsets are equipped with a structure of commutative monoid %(i.e.\ we can add morphisms and there is a $0$ morphism)
%, it is Cartesian closed%(with the closed structure compatible with the additive structure)
and with a certain \emph{differential operator} $D$, generalising the usual notion of differential, see e.g.\ \cite{BluteEhrhTass10}.
%An example is the CC$\partial\lambda$C of convenient vector spaces with smooth maps, where $D$ is the ``real'' differential $Df:\mathbb{V}\times\mathbb{V}\rightarrow \mathbb{W}$, $Df(x,u):=\dfrac{d}{dt}{\!\Big|_{t=0}} f(x+tu)$, of smooth maps $f:\mathbb{V}\rightarrow \mathbb{W}$.
%More precisely, a cartesian category $\C C$ is a $C\partial C$ when:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\C C$ is left-additive, i.e.~its hom-sets have the structure of commutative monoids, and the cartesian structure is well-behaved w.r.t.~this monoid structure;
%\item $\C C$ is equipped with a differential operator $D:
%\C C(X,Y)\to \C C(X\times X,Y)$ satisfying some axioms which capture usual properties of differentials (e.g.~the linearity of $D$ in one of its two variables, the chain rule, etc.).
%\end{itemize}
Now, applying \cite[Theorem 6.1]{lemay2020} one can check that
%\begin{proposition}[{\color{red}LEMAY??}]\label{thm:LREL!CCDC}
 $\LREL_!$ becomes a CC$\partial\lambda$C, i.e.\ a model of the $\STDLC$, when equipped with the \emph{tropical differential operator} $D:\HOM{\LREL}{!X}{Y}\to \HOM{\LREL}{!(X\& X)}{Y}$ defined as $(Dt)_{\mu\oplus\rho,b}=t_{\rho+\mu,b}$ if $\#\mu=1$ and as $\infty$ otherwise (using the iso $(\mu,\rho)\in !Z\times !Z'\mapsto\mu\oplus\rho \in !(Z+Z')$).
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{remark}For $t\in\HOM{\LREL}{!X}{Y}$, we have: $D^2 t\in\HOM{\LREL_!}{(X+X)+(X+X)}{Y}$, where $(D^2 t)_{(\rho\oplus\rho')\oplus(\nu\oplus\nu'),b}$ equals $t_{\nu+\nu'+\rho',b}$ if $\rho=\emptyset$ and $\#\rho'=1=\#\nu$; it equals $t_{\rho+\nu',b}$ if $\rho'=\emptyset=\nu$ and $\#\rho=1$; it equals $\infty$ otherwise.\end{remark}
%This ensures that one can define a sound interpretation of $\STDLC$-terms in the standard way (see [Section 4.3, \cite{Manzo2010}]).
This model is also well-behaved w.r.t.\ the Taylor expansion, as expressed by the following two results.
As it can be patientely checked, in $(\LREL_!,D)$ all morphisms can be Taylor expanded  (see \cite[Definition 4.22]{Manzo2012}):

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:modelsTaylor}
 For all $t\in\HOM{\LREL_!}{Z}{X\multimap Y}$, $s\in\HOM{\LREL_!}{Z}{X}$ we have:%, the evaluation of $t$ over $s$ yields 
 \begin{align}\label{eq:taylorcat}
  \RM{ev}\circ_!\langle t,s\rangle =
  \inf\limits_{n\in\N}
  \set{((\dots((\Lambda^- t)\star s)\star \dots)\star s)\circ_! \langle \RM{id},\infty \rangle}.
 \end{align} 
\end{theorem}
%It is worth discussing the formula above a bit more. 
Here,
%:\HOM{\LREL}{!Z}{X\multimap Y}\to \HOM{\LREL}{!(Z+X)}{Y}$
%$\star:\HOM{\LREL}{!(Z+X)}{Y}\times\HOM{\LREL}{!Z}{X}\to \HOM{\LREL}{!(Z+X)}{Y}$ is defined as 
$u\star s= (Du)\circ_{!} \langle \langle  \infty, s\circ_{!} \pi_{1}\rangle,\mathrm{id}\rangle$ corresponds to the application of the derivative of $u$ on $s$, and $\Lambda^-$ is the uncurry operator.
Hence the right-hand term in \eqref{eq:taylorcat} corresponds to the $\inf$ of the $n$-th derivative of $\Lambda^{-}t$ applied to ``$n$ copies'' of $s$,  i.e.~it coincides with the tropical %interpretation of the
version of the usual Taylor expansion.
%Moreover, since $\LREL_!$ has countable sums (all $\inf$'s converge), and thanks to equation \eqref{eq:taylorcat}, an immediate adaptation of the proof of [Theorem 4.23, \cite{Manzo2012}] entails that the interpretation of the $\STDLC$-Taylor expansion of a $\STLC$-term $M$ given in \eqref{eq:taylor}, converges to the interpretation of $M$.
Finally, since $\LREL_!$ has countable sums (all countable $\inf$s converge), an immediate adaptation of the proof of \cite[Theorem 4.23]{Manzo2012} shows:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:T(M)=M}
 If $\Gamma\vdash_{\STLC} M:A$, then $\model{\Gamma\vdash_{\STDLC} \Te M:A}:=\inf_{t\in\Te{M}} \model{\Gamma\vdash_{\STDLC} t:A}$ converges to $\model{\Gamma\vdash_{\STLC} M:A}$. %the interpretation of the Taylor expansion of a $\STLC$-term $M$, given in \eqref{eq:taylor}, converges to the one of $M$.
\end{corollary}

As already mentioned, by straightforward induction on $M$ (using that composition and $D$ easily preserve ``booleaness'' and projections and evaluation of  $\LREL$ are boolean) one can prove that:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:descrete}
 For all the previous four languages, except $\STLC_\oplus$, we have that $\model{\Gamma\vdash M:A}\in\Lawv^{!\model{\Gamma}\times\model{A}}$ is a \emph{boolean} matrix, i.e.\ actually $\model{\Gamma\vdash M:A}\in\{0,\infty\}^{!\model{\Gamma}\times\model{A}}$.
\end{proposition}

Even if the interpretation of those languages is trivia, we shall still focus on them in order to set the basis of the further studies and in order to see some already interesting properties of their interpretation.{\color{red}SPIEGARE MEGLIO}

%More formally, the differential operator $\Der[-]$ transforms a function $M:A\to B$ into a function $\Der[M]: A\to (A\to B)$ which is linear in its first argument. 
%Since $M$ may rather ask for several copies of $N$, this requires a form of non-determinism: 
%For example, if $M$ is the term $\lambda fx.f(fx)$ considered before, $\Der[M]$ takes a first input $N$ and passes it linearly to $M$. Notice that there are two ways of doing so, corresponding to the two bound occurrences of $f$ in $M$: either by applying $N$ to $fx$, or by 
%applying $f$ linearly to $Nx$ (indeed, if $f$ were applied in an unrestricted way, it might duplicate $Nx$, so that $N$ would not be used linearly). This justifies the equation below, in which $\Der[M]$ is identified with the non-deterministic sum of the two possible linear choices:
%\begin{align}
%\Der\left[\lambda f x.f(fx)\right]\cdot N = 
%\lambda fx. N(fx) + \left(\Der[f]\cdot (Nx)\right)(fx)
%\end{align}
%More generally, one can define a notion of $k$-bounded application $\Der^{(k)}[M]\cdot N^{k}$, where $\Der^{(0)}[M]\cdot N^{0}= M$ and $\Der^{(k+1)}[M]\cdot N^{k+1}= \Der[ \Der^{(k)}[M]\cdot N^{k}]\cdot N$, corresponding to passing $N$ to $M$ exactly $k$ times.
%
%
%The name ``differential'' for the operator $\Der[-]$ is justified by the fact that it satisfies many properties of the usual differential operator of analysis $\Der[f]:= \lambda xy. \frac{\mathsf df(y)}{\mathsf dy}\cdot x$. Notably, it is additive in its first variable (i.e.~it commutes with the non-deterministic sum operator), and satisfies the chain rule.
%Most famously, the differential operator can be used to define a Taylor formula for $\lambda$-terms, which decomposes an unrestricted application into a formal non-deterministic sum of bounded applications:

%
%More generally, the relational semantics interprets unbounded programs as \emph{analytic functions}, that is, as functions admitting a representation as power series. For instance, observing that an analytic map $f: \BB R\to \BB R$, where $f(x)=\sum_{n}\widehat f_{n}\cdot x^{n}$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $\widehat f_{n}$, the program $M_{\infty}:=\lambda fx.fx: (\BB R\To \BB R)\To (\BB R\To \BB R)$ is represented by the power series below:
%\begin{align}
%F_{\infty}(f,x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \widehat f_{n} x^{n}
%\end{align}
%By restricting ourselves to bounded applications, the terms in the power series become finite, that is, the interpretation becomes a \emph{polynomial}: for instance, the program $M_{2}:=\lambda fx. \sum_{i=0}^{2}\Der^{(i)}[f]\cdot x^{i}$, corresponding to passing $x$ \emph{at most twice} to $f$, is represented by the polynomial
%\begin{align}
%F_{\leq 2}(f,x)=\widehat f_{2} x^{2}  + \widehat f_{1}x +  \widehat f_{0} 
%\end{align}
% In this framework the differential operator is naturally represented by formal differentiation of polynomials, where, as one would expect, 
% $\Der[\sum_{n}a_{n}x^{n}]=\sum_{n}\Der[a_{n}x^{n}]$ and $\Der[a_{0}x^{0}]=0$ and $\Der[a_{n+1}x^{n+1}]= (n+1)a_{n+1}x^{n}$, so that power series can be Taylor expanded.
