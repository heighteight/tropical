%TODO mandatory: add short abstract of the document
\begin{abstract}
In this paper we study an interpretation of the $\lambda$-calculus in the framework of tropical mathematics, by considering the relational semantics weighted on the tropical semiring.
We consider it as providing a unified framework where both program metrics, as based on the analysis of program sensitivity via Lipschitz-conditions, and resource analysis, as based on higher-order program differentiation, coexist. This is possible thanks to the fact that this is also a model of both a graded lambda-calculus ensuring bounded duplications, and the differential lambda-calculus. We only show the starting result of our line of research: thanks to the tropical operations we consider, in such model programs with bounded duplication are Lipschitz maps, simply typed terms are locally Lipschitz maps and the differential terms appearing in the Taylor expansion of a term (also called resource terms) are Lipschitz maps. Therefore, the lambda-calculus Taylor expansion decomposes semantically the simply typed term as an inf of more and more sensitive functions.

\subsection{... As (weighted relational) model of several $\lambda$-calculi}

The category $\LREL$ satisfies many nice properties which make it able to model all the variants of the $\lambda$-calculi to which we are interested in here.
Although the majority of the properties mentioned in the present section are shared with the general class of models of $\lambda$-calculi called \emph{weighted relational models}, thoroughly studied in \cite{Manzo2013}, we mention them for our particular case in order to highlight how these look like in the tropical setting.
Moreover, we end the section by stating some property of $\LREL$ not necessarily shared with all the models in the general class.
The real interest in our particular model will come in the next \autoref{sec:tls}.

\subsection{Generalized Metric Spaces and Modules over the Lawvere Quantale}\label{section6}
%At the basis of our approach is the observation that the \emph{tropical semiring} $([0,\infty], \min, +)$, which is at the heart of tropical mathematics, coincides with the \emph{Lawvere quantale} $\Lawv=([0,\infty], \geq, +)$ \cite{Hofmann2014, Stubbe2014}, the structure at the heart of the categorical study of metric spaces initiated by Lawvere himself \cite{Lawvere1973}.
%Let us recall that a quantale is a complete lattice endowed with a continuous monoid action. In the case of $\Lawv$ the lattice is defined by the reverse order $\geq$ on $\BB R$, and the monoid action is provided by addition. Notice that the lattice join operation of $\Lawv$ coincides with the idempotent semiring operation $\min$. 
%A consequence of these observations is that, as we discussed below, the tropical approach to linear algebra coincides with the study of ``$\Lawv$-valued matrices'', i.e.~of maps of the form $s: X\times Y\to \Lawv$ .
%In particular, a (possibly $\infty$) metric on a set $X$ is nothing but a ``$\Lawv$-valued square matrix'' $d:X\times X\to \Lawv$ satisfying axioms like e.g.~the triangular law (indeed, such distance matrices correspond to $\Lawv$-\emph{enriched categories}, a viewpoint we explicitly take in Section \ref{section6}).
