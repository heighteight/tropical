%TODO mandatory: add short abstract of the document
\begin{abstract}
We study the interpretation of the lambda-calculus in a framework based on tropical mathematics, and we show that it provides a unified framework for both program  metrics, based on the analysis of program sensitivity via Lipschitz conditions, and resource analysis, based on higher-order program differentiation. 
To do that we focus on the semantics arising from the relational model weighted over the tropical semiring, and we discuss its application to the study of “best case” program behavior for languages with probabilistic and non-deterministic effects. Finally, we show that a general foundation for this approach is provided by an abstract correspondence between tropical algebra and Lawvere’s theory of generalized metric spaces.
%A typical result of such line of research is that, thanks to the tropical operations, a simply typed term is interpreted as a locally Lipschitz map, which is in turn decomposed as an inf of more and more sensitive Lipschitz ones, corresponding to the interpretations of the approximants given by the lambda-calculus Taylor expansion.
%We finally describe some promising lines of research, showing in particular how such tropical model expresses natural optimisation problems of probabilistic calculi.

%%The category $\LREL$ satisfies many nice properties which make it able to model all the variants of the $\lambda$-calculi to which we are interested in here. Although the majority of such properties are shared with the general class of models of $\lambda$-calculi called \emph{weighted relational models}, thoroughly studied in \cite{Manzo2013}, we mention them for our particular case in order to highlight how these look like in the tropical setting, but also to make the non-expert in such topics reader able to follow.
%%The real interest in our particular model will come in the next \autoref{sec:tls}.

%\subsection{Generalized Metric Spaces and Modules over the Lawvere Quantale}\label{section6}
%%At the basis of our approach is the observation that the \emph{tropical semiring} $([0,\infty], \min, +)$, which is at the heart of tropical mathematics, coincides with the \emph{Lawvere quantale} $\Lawv=([0,\infty], \geq, +)$ \cite{Hofmann2014, Stubbe2014}, the structure at the heart of the categorical study of metric spaces initiated by Lawvere himself \cite{Lawvere1973}.
%Let us recall that a quantale is a complete lattice endowed with a continuous monoid action. In the case of $\Lawv$ the lattice is defined by the reverse order $\geq$ on $\BB R$, and the monoid action is provided by addition. Notice that the lattice join operation of $\Lawv$ coincides with the idempotent semiring operation $\min$. 
%A consequence of these observations is that, as we discussed below, the tropical approach to linear algebra coincides with the study of ``$\Lawv$-valued matrices'', i.e.~of maps of the form $s: X\times Y\to \Lawv$ .
%In particular, a (possibly $\infty$) metric on a set $X$ is nothing but a ``$\Lawv$-valued square matrix'' $d:X\times X\to \Lawv$ satisfying axioms like e.g.~the triangular law (indeed, such distance matrices correspond to $\Lawv$-\emph{enriched categories}, a viewpoint we explicitly take in Section \ref{section6}).
