	Abstract = { Computational convex analysis algorithms have been rediscovered several times in the past by researchers from different fields. To further communications between practitioners, we review the field of computational convex analysis, which focuses on the numerical computation of fundamental transforms arising from convex analysis. Current models use symbolic, numeric, and hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms. Our objective is to disseminate widely the most efficient numerical algorithms useful for applications in image processing (computing the distance transform, the generalized distance transform, and mathematical morphology operators), partial differential equations (solving Hamilton--Jacobi equations and using differential equations numerical schemes to compute the convex envelope), max-plus algebra (computing the equivalent of the fast Fourier transform), multifractal analysis, etc. The fields of applications include, among others, computer vision, robot navigation, thermodynamics, electrical networks, medical imaging, and network communication. },

	Abstract = {We show that several decision problems originating from max-plus or tropical convexity are equivalent to zero-sum two player game problems. In particular, we set up an equivalence between the external representation of tropical convex sets and zero-sum stochastic games, in which tropical polyhedra correspond to deterministic games with finite action spaces. Then, we show that the winning initial positions can be determined from the associated tropical polyhedron. We obtain as a corollary a game theoretical proof of the fact that the tropical rank of a matrix, defined as the maximal size of a submatrix for which the optimal assignment problem has a unique solution, coincides with the maximal number of rows (or columns) of the matrix which are linearly independent in the tropical sense.

	Abstract = {We study a family of distributors-induced bicategorical models of Î»-calculus, proving that they can be syntactically presented via intersection type systems. We first introduce a class of 2-monads whose algebras are monoidal categories modelling resource management. We lift these monads to distributors and define a parametric Kleisli bicategory, giving a sufficient condition for its cartesian closure. In this framework we define a proof-relevant semantics: the interpretation of a term associates to it the set of its typing derivations in appropriate systems. We prove that our model characterize solvability, adapting reducibility techniques to our setting. We conclude by describing two examples of our construction.},

	Abstract = {The exponential modality of linear logic associates to every formula A a commutative comonoid !A which can be duplicated in the course of reasoning. Here, we explain how to compute the free commutative comonoid !A as a sequential limit of equalizers in any symmetric monoidal category where this sequential limit exists and commutes with the tensor product. We apply this general recipe to a series of models of linear logic, typically based on coherence spaces, Conway games and finiteness spaces. This algebraic description unifies for the first time a number of apparently different constructions of the exponential modality in spaces and games. It also sheds light on the duplication policy of linear logic, and its interaction with classical duality and double negation completion.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a new denotational model of linear logic based on the purely relational model. In this semantics, webs are equipped with a notion of `finitary'subsets satisfying a closure condition and proofs are interpreted as finitary sets. In spite of a formal similarity, this model is quite different from the usual models of linear logic (coherence semantics, hypercoherence semantics, the various existing game semantics{\ldots}). In particular, the standard fix-point operators used for defining the general recursive functions are not finitary, although the primitive recursion operators are. This model can be considered as a discrete analogue of the K{\"o}the space semantics introduced in a previous paper: we show how, given a field, each finiteness space gives rise to a vector space endowed with a linear topology, a notion introduced by Lefschetz in 1942, and we study the corresponding model where morphisms are linear continuous maps (a version of Girard's quantitative semantics with coefficients in the field). In this way we obtain a new model of the recently introduced differential lambda-calculus.},

	Abstract = {Graded linear exponential comonads are an extension of linear exponential comonads wih grading, and provide a categorical semantics of resource-sensitive exponential modality in linear logic. In this paper, we propose a concise double-category theoretic formulation of graded linear exponential comonads as a kind of monoid homomorphisms from the multiplicative monoids of semirings to the composition monoids of symmetric monoidal endofunctors. We also exploit this formulation to derive the category of graded comonoid-coalgebras, which decompose graded linear exponential comonads into symmetric monoidal adjunctions plus twists.},

	Abstract = {Higher-order probabilistic programming languages allow programmers to write sophisticated models in machine learning and statistics in a succinct and structured way, but step outside the standard measure-theoretic formalization of probability theory. Programs may use both higher-order functions and continuous distributions, or even define a probability distribution on functions. But standard probability theory does not handle higher-order functions well: the category of measurable spaces is not cartesian closed.Here we introduce quasi-Borel spaces. We show that these spaces: form a new formalization of probability theory replacing measurable spaces; form a cartesian closed category and so support higher-order functions; form a well-pointed category and so support good proof principles for equational reasoning; and support continuous probability distributions. We demonstrate the use of quasi-Borel spaces for higher-order functions and probability by: showing that a well-known construction of probability theory involving random functions gains a cleaner expression; and generalizing de Finetti's theorem, that is a crucial theorem in probability theory, to quasi-Borel spaces.},

	Abstract = {We define two intersection type systems for the pure, untyped, probabilistic Î»-calculus, and prove that type derivations precisely reflect the probability of convergence of the underlying term. We first define a simple system of oracle intersection types in which derivations are annotated by binary strings and the probability of termination can be computed by combining all the different possible annotations. Although inevitable due to recursion theoretic limitations, the fact that (potentially) infinitely many derivations need to be considered is of course an issue when seeing types as a verification methodology. We thus develop a more complex system: the monadic intersection type system. In this second system, the probability of termination of a term is shown to be the least upper bound of the weights of its type derivations.},

@article{Dosen2003,
	Abstract = {{$[$}Some thirty years ago, two proposals were made concerning criteria for identity of proofs. Prawitz proposed to analyze identity of proofs in terms of the equivalence relation based on reduction to normal form in natural deduction. Lambek worked on a normalization proposal analogous to Prawitz's, based on reduction to cut-free form in sequent systems, but he also suggested understanding identity of proofs in terms of an equivalence relation based on generality, two derivations having the same generality if after generalizing maximally the rules involved in them they yield the same premises and conclusions up to a renaming of variables. These two proposals proved to be extensionally equivalent only for limited fragments of logic. The normalization proposal stands behind very successful applications of the typed lambda calculus and of category theory in the proof theory of intuitionistic logic. In classical logic, however, it did not fare well. The generality proposal was rather neglected in logic, though related matters were much studied in pure category theory in connection with coherence problems, and there are also links to low-dimensional topology and linear algebra. This proposal seems more promising than the other one for the general proof theory of classical logic.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {We introduce the resource calculus, a string diagrammatic language for concurrent systems. Significantly, it uses the same syntax and operational semantics as the signal flow calculus --- an algebraic formalism for signal flow graphs, which is a combinatorial model of computation of interest in control theory. Indeed, our approach stems from the simple but fruitful observation that, by replacing real numbers (modelling signals) with natural numbers (modelling resources) in the operational semantics, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. The resource calculus is canonical: we equip it and its stateful extension with equational theories that characterise the underlying space of definable behaviours---a convex algebraic universe of additive relations---via isomorphisms of categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our calculus is sufficiently expressive to capture behaviour definable by classical Petri nets.},

	Abstract = {In any setting in which observable properties have a quantitative flavor, it is natural to compare computational objects by way of metrics rather than equivalences or partial orders. This holds, in particular, for probabilistic higher-order programs. A natural notion of comparison, then, becomes context distance, the metric analogue of Morris' context equivalence. In this paper, we analyze the main properties of the context distance in fully-fledged probabilistic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculi, this way going beyond the state of the art, in which only affine calculi were considered. We first of all study to which extent the context distance trivializes, giving a sufficient condition for trivialization. We then characterize context distance by way of a coinductively-defined, tuple-based notion of distance in one of those calculi, called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varLambda ^{\backslash}oplus {\_}!{\$}{\$}. We finally derive pseudometrics for call-by-name and call-by-value probabilistic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculi, and prove them fully-abstract.},

To do so a general, abstract framework for studying behavioural relations taking values over quantales is introduced according to Lawvere's analysis of generalised metric spaces. Barr's notion of relator (or lax extension) is then extended to quantale-valued relations, adapting and extending results from the field of monoidal topology. Abstract notions of quantale-valued effectful applicative similarity and bisimilarity are then defined and proved to be a compatible generalised metric (in the sense of Lawvere) and pseudometric, respectively, under mild conditions.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a linear analogue of L{\"a}uchli's semantics for intuitionistic logic. In fact, our result is a strengthening of L{\"a}uchli's work to the level of proofs, rather than provability. This is obtained by considering continuous actions of the additive group of integers on a category of topological vector spaces. The semantics, based on functorial polymorphism, consists of dinatural transformations which are equivariant with respect to all such actions. Such dinatural transformations are called uniform. To any sequent in Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), we associate a vector space of``diadditive'' uniform transformations. We then show that this space is generated by denotations of cut-free proofs of the sequent in the theory MLL + MIX. Thus we obtain a full completeness theorem in the sense of Abramsky and Jagadeesan, although our result differs from theirs in the use of dinatural transformations. As corollaries, we show that these dinatural transformations compose, and obtain a conservativity result: diadditive dinatural transformations which are uniform with respect to actions of the additive group of integers are also uniform with respect to the actions of arbitrary cocommutative Hopf algebras. Finally, we discuss several possible extensions of this work to noncommutative logic. It is well known that the intuitionistic version of L{\"a}uchli's semantics is a special case of the theory of logical relations, due to Plotkin and Statman. Thus, our work can also be viewed as a first step towards developing a theory of logical relations for linear logic and concurrency.},

	Abstract = {Higher-dimensional dependent type theory enriches conventional one-dimensional dependent type theory with additional structure expressing equivalence of elements of a type. This structure may be employed in a variety of ways to capture rather coarse identifications of elements, such as a universe of sets considered modulo isomorphism. Equivalence must be respected by all families of types and terms, as witnessed computationally by a type-generic program. Higher-dimensional type theory has applications to code reuse for dependently typed programming, and to the formalization of mathematics. In this paper, we develop a novel judgemental formulation of a two-dimensional type theory, which enjoys a canonicity property: a closed term of boolean type is definitionally equal to true or false. Canonicity is a necessary condition for a computational interpretation of type theory as a programming language, and does not hold for existing axiomatic presentations of higher-dimensional type theory. The method of proof is a generalization of the NuPRL semantics, interpreting types as syntactic groupoids rather than equivalence relations.},

In so doing, Quine devastated the philosophical programs that depend upon a notion of analyticity -- specifically, the linguistic theory of necessary truth, and the analytic theory of a priori knowledge.},

@article{Knuth,
	Abstract = {By presenting these examples, I have tried to illustrate four main points. 1) Finite numbers can be really enormous, and the known universe is very small. Therefore the distinction between finite and infinite is not as relevant as the distinction between realistic and unrealistic. 2) In many cases there are subtle ways to solve very large problems quickly, in spite of the fact that they appear at first to require examination of too many possibilities. 3) There are also cases where we can prove that a fairly natural problem is intrinsically hard, far beyond our conceivable capabilities. 4) It takes a good deal of skill to decide whether a given problem is in the easy or hard class; but even if a problem does turn out to be hard there are useful and interesting ways to change it into one that can be done satisfactorily.},
