General discussion: optimization properties behave in a Lipschitz way.


- differential privacy and Lipschitzness


- log-probabilities and tropical roots 


- counting computation steps (from Manzonetto, but add relational ``Lipschitz'' reasoning)


- measuring duplications of discrete functions (needs finiteness!)
